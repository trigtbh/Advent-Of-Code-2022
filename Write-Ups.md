Thoughts about each day's set of problems

---

## Day 1
- Back at it again lmaoooooo
- Don't know if I'll do the super hard version of this that I did last year
- (No imports, must be complete in 24 hours)
- **Rank: `117 / 116`**
- **Time: `00:01:20 / 00:02:08`**

## Day 2
- Performed worse lol
- Honestly kinda my fault cuz I got distracted and took the slowest methods possible
- **Rank: `277 / 195`**
- **Time: `00:01:20 / 00:02:08`**

## Day 3
- Did this at 3 in the morning don't judge
- **Rank: `48121 / 43833`**
- **Time: `06:40:31 / 06:56:40`**

## Day 4
- Embarrassing that for a set this easy, it took me this long
- **Rank: `299 / 363`**
- **Time: `00:02:53 / 00:04:47`**

## Day 5
- I did so bad on this day lmaoooo
- Input parsing is *not fun*
- **Rank: `657 / 844`**
- **Time: `00:11:16 / 00:14:46`**

## Day 6
- Started 20 minutes late smh
- Wayyyyyyy too easy for a day 6 problem imo
- **Rank: `12489 / 11084`**
- **Time: `00:23:39 / 00:24:01`**
- (note the **21 second difference** between parts 1 and 2)

## Day 7
- I call this one the Great AoC Tragedy
- Got distracted as soon as part 1 started
- Misread part 2 a total of 3 times
- And ended up with the ugliest solution known to man
- Still managed to get top 500...? Not like it means much
- **Rank: `312 / 464`**
- **Time: `00:15:18 / 00:21:41`**

## Day 8
- Took way too long for me to do
- Sometimes, a harder solution is better than a smarter solution
- Part 1 is 100% pep8 compliant (trust me) (don't look into it) (this is a joke line 17 is 240 characters long)
- **Rank: `7654 / 7430`**
- **Time: `00:40:45 / 01:08:35`**
